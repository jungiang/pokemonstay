# Pokemon Stay

##### https://pokestay.jungiang.com

This repo contains the Pokemon Stay Application. Designed for desktop and tablet sized screens, the app is a memory match game based on the original 151 pokemon series. Click on cards to unveil random pokemon hidden behind them. When a pair has been matched, it will be added to your collection. Once you have caught all the pokemon on the field or when you reset the day manually, it will be repopulated with new random pokemon. Your collection persists even after exiting the game, so you can keep adding to it whenever you want!
